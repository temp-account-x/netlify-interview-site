## What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?

The self-esteem a good technical support role provides is my favorite part. It makes me feel good about myself when I believe in the product/service and the organization I am a part of. When I believe in what I am supporting, the work feels meaningful - like I am contributing to the betterment of humanity. The experience of having smart people (often much smarter than I am) contact me for assistance with the software for which I am one of the resident experts can feel like a great responsibility but also a great joy if/when we can solve the problem or get the questions needing answers answered. To summarize, it feels good to do meaningful work and that is what a good tech support role should be.
