## Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?

Personally, interviewing candidates and creating job postings isn't one of my strengths (which is why I included it in my 'least favorite' list above). That being said I liked this test. I found it fair and comprehensive. It also allows plenty of room for personal expression giving the candidate a great degree of freedom when answering. The open-ended aspects of the test are my favorites in that they are a bit like a Rorschach test, allowing the personality of the interviewee to be reflected where there is no 'right answer'. tl;dr - I would take this test again!
