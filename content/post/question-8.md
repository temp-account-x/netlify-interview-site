## A customer writes in saying their “site won’t build”.  Compose:

- your best short (2-paragraph) customer-facing answer,
- without any additional data,
- that could be useful in the generic case,
- but would also lead to a customer providing a more actionable response.

Hello Person,

Thank you for letting us know that there are issues getting the site to build and deploy. In order to find out why this is occurring and get it resolved a few more details would be helpful. Would you be willing to please answer the following questions?

1. Which site is not building? You can see the list of sites deployed with Netlify here: https://app.netlify.com/account/sites.
2. Does the site build locally for you?
3. If 'yes' to question 2, what is the command used to build the site locally?
4. If 'no' to question 2, what is the error when locally building the site?
5. What happens when you try to deploy the site with Netlify (please copy/paste the error or include a screenshot if needed)?

Please let me know if there are questions for me and I will be happy to answer. I look forward to finding out why this build issue is occurring and to getting the site building successfully again.
