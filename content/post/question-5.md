## Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, which you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.

I love the Arch Linux documentation:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_page

There are several things I like about the Arch Linux docs. First, simplicity is an aesthetic I value. I love minimalism in documentation. I like images kept to a minimum (unless it is documentation of software with a GUI). I like code/configuration examples which can be copy/pasted. The Arch Linux docs deliver in this respect.

I also like the documentation to be written by people that have actually performed the process being described. The fact that it is a wiki allows the documentation to be updated and for there to be a public revision history. The reliability and transparency of the documentation are a big selling points for me.

This is documentation that actually works. Like the Ubuntu forums, the Arch Linux wikis and forums are a valuable source of information for people working with Linux. This is documentation I can count on. And when I find mistakes or edge cases, I can update the docs to share those details with other interested people.
